# final-project: Movie Miner
Final project for JSFSummer2021

Created by: Cameron Schultz

This project was an attempt at making a site where the user can view new movie releases and popular movies. Additionally the site allows the user to search for movies by title or keyword. This project gave me a much better understanding of working with APIs. In the future I hope to be able to add more options for how content can be viewed and searched. I also plan on improving the ui/ux for an overall improved experience.

## Installation
First download all code files onto your computer, or copy the files from the repository into your own files accordingly. From there, open the files in an application like Visual Studio Code. Once you reach this point, simply "go live" (open in a browser) from the HTML file and enjoy.

Additionally, you can follow this link to view the project.
